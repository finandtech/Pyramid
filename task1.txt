Function plan

To add space between the each number on the pyramid, we take the lenght and add one unit and 
we times it by the number of our choice, Line 3

For every number there will be one unit of space, our number increases by 1 unit, if we have 2 spaces we have 3 numbers and so on. 

          1     <- 0 spaces
         2"2    <- 1 space
        3"3"3   <- 2 spaces


" = one unit of space

We do so by adding an empty string of space and the results are printed. We summon the function and that is it.
